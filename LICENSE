The term MCLUST used here refers to all versions of the software, including
contributed R language (CRAN) packages named mclust, mclust02, and mclust98, 
and the mclust package available in the S archive of Statlib. 

Conditions under which the University of Washington allows the use of MCLUST 
by academic and non-profit users for internal research are described below.

The University of Washington and the developers of MCLUST, Chris Fraley 
and Adrian Raftery in the Department of Statistics, give permission for you 
and your Institution to copy, perform, display and modify the MCLUST software 
under the following conditions:  

1. the MCLUST software, including any modifications you may have made to it, 
   remains at your Institution and is not published, distributed, or 
   otherwise transferred or made available in whole or in part, modified or 
   unmodified, to other than Institution employees and/or students under your 
   direct supervision;

2. you retain in MCLUST and any modifications to MCLUST the copyright, 
   trademark, or other notices pertaining to MCLUST as provided by the 
   University of Washington;

3. you provide the MCLUST developers with feedback on the use of the MCLUST 
   software in your research, and you permit the MCLUST developers and 
   University of Washington to use any information you provide in making 
   changes to the MCLUST software; 

4. you acknowledge the right of the University of Washington to prepare and 
   publish modifications to MCLUST that may be substantially similar or 
   functionally equivalent to your modifications and improvements, and if you 
   obtain patent protection for any modification or improvement to MCLUST you 
   agree not to allege or enjoin infringement of your patent by the 
   University of Washington or by any of the University of Washington's 
   licensees obtaining modifications or improvements to MCLUST from the 
   University of Washington; 

5. you acknowledge in your publications contributions to your research 
   involving or based on the MCLUST software by citing the following 
   references (bibtex entries can be found at the bottom of this file);

6. those whose only use of MCLUST is through one of the following packages
   prabclus, fpc, clustvarsel, spotSegmentation, or latentnet must cite the primary 
   references associated with those  packages but need not cite the 
   above references as a condition for software use --- 
   all other provisions of the license apply;

7. any risk associated with using the MCLUST software at your Institution 
   is with you and your Institution. MCLUST is experimental in nature and
