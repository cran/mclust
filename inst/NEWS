      initialization step.

      Gaussian mixture distribution.

      matrix of 1s on a single column for z even in the case of G = 1. This 
      is to avoid error on some plots.

      variables or a transformation of them should be used for
      hierarchical clustering.
    o included "hcUse" in mclust.options to be passed as default to hc().
    o original data (and class for classification models) are stored in the
      object returned by the main functions.

      of the noise component when required, otherwise is set to NA.
    o add a warning when prior is used and BIC returns NAs.
    o bug fixes for summary.Mclust(), print.summary.Mclust(), plot.Mclust() 
      and icl() in the case of presence of a noise component.
    o some plots on plot.MclustDR() require plot.new() before calling
      plot.window().
